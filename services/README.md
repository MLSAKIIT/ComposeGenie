# Docker Compose Generator - Microservices

## Overview
The services directory contains specialized microservices that handle specific aspects of the Docker Compose generation and validation process.

## Architecture
```
services/
├── security-scanner/     # Vulnerability scanning service
├── template-generator/   # Template management service
└── config-validator/     # Configuration validation service
```

## Services

### Security Scanner Service
**Purpose**: Performs vulnerability scanning and security analysis of Docker images and configurations.

**Features**:
- CVE database integration
- Docker image layer analysis
- Security best practices validation
- Compliance checking (CIS, NIST)
- Real-time threat intelligence

**Technology**: Python with FastAPI, Trivy scanner integration

### Template Generator Service
**Purpose**: Manages and generates Docker Compose templates from various sources.

**Features**:
- Template CRUD operations
- Dynamic template generation
- Version management
- Template marketplace integration
- Custom template validation

**Technology**: Node.js with Express, Template engine integration

### Config Validator Service
**Purpose**: Validates Docker Compose configurations for best practices and potential issues.

**Features**:
- Syntax validation
- Resource limit analysis
- Network configuration validation
- Volume mount security checks
- Service dependency analysis
- Performance optimization suggestions

**Technology**: Go with Gin framework, Docker API integration

## Inter-Service Communication
- **Message Queue**: Redis for async communication
- **Service Discovery**: Consul for service registration
- **API Gateway**: Kong for request routing and rate limiting
- **Monitoring**: Prometheus + Grafana for observability

## Deployment
Each service can be deployed independently using Docker containers:
- Individual Dockerfiles for each service
- Kubernetes manifests for orchestration
- Helm charts for easy deployment
- CI/CD pipelines for automated testing and deployment

## Development
Each service directory contains:
- `README.md` - Service-specific documentation
- `Dockerfile` - Container definition
- `docker-compose.yml` - Local development setup
- Source code and tests
- Configuration files

## Security Considerations
- Service-to-service authentication using JWT
- API rate limiting and request validation
- Secure secrets management
- Network segmentation
- Regular security updates and scanning

## Monitoring and Logging
- Centralized logging with ELK stack
- Distributed tracing with Jaeger
- Health checks and metrics collection
- Alerting for service failures
